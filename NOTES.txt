FAQ: 
  Why not use <table> element? 
    -Since the reading order makes sense, no formal table structure is needed. Header information is not needed to understand the data, the aria-labels provide the needed context information needed for each oval.
    A table-like layout was used just for presentation purposes only. 
      Note: If content can be understood in reading order (or when the content is linearized), this test DOES NOT APPLY (DNA).

CONSIDERATIONS:
-adding an alert box when voteMax has been reached 
-adding a notification for a voteFor 1 and the previous candidate becomes deselected
